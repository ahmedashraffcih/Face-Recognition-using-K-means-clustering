# Face-Recognition-using-K-means-clustering

K-means algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, that tries to cluster similar data into K clusters where each cluster has a centroide (center) that represents It. Each cluster contains the data that are similar as much as each other as possible and of course the data not in the same cluster are as different as possible.


## Prerequisites

In order to exploit that project you'll need data of faces that you want to recognize.

Also you'll need to donwload and install the following python packages :

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* SickitLearn
* Pandas
* Mysql Connector
